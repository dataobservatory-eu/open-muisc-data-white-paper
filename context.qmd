# Policy Context

The _Music Ecosystem 2025_ study was motivated by the recognition that Europe’s music sector is no longer a simple value chain but a complex, interconnected ecosystem shaped by globalisation, platform dominance, and rapid technological change[^musicecosystemnote]. Its authors sought to capture this systemic transformation, addressing cultural diversity, economic precarity, the rise of AI, and the social and environmental sustainability of music in Europe. Our policy brief builds on this systemic perspective but adds a more focused angle: we look specifically at data and metadata as the critical infrastructure of the ecosystem. Where the Music Ecosystem 2025 study emphasises openness, cooperation, and resilience at the macro level, we show how these goals can be operationalised at the micro level of interoperable identifiers, lifecycle-based metadata sharing, and autonomous systems. Our aim is to ensure that automation and big data work for the music industry and cultural institutions, not against them — reducing inefficiencies, empowering small actors, and strengthening Europe’s capacity to compete fairly in a platform-driven global market.
