# Context

The European music ecosystem has undergone disruptive transformations in recent decades. 
In the 2010s, the arrival of agentic AI in streaming platforms radically reconfigured 
distribution and consumption. These systems centralised global sales, expanding the 
commercially available repertoire in a typical EU country from roughly 100,000 titles to 
over 100 million competitors. At the same time, the average transaction value collapsed 
from around €18 (in current prices) to less than €0.005. This shock hollowed out much of 
the traditional infrastructure — record stores, radios, and music television — and shifted 
value capture toward data-driven platforms able to control access through recommender 
algorithms.

In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI further exacerbates this situation. 
Large-scale models can mass-produce new compositions and recordings, often imitating or 
plagiarising patterns of human creators. This inflates supply, undermines the position of 
professional authors and performers, and aggravates existing problems of remuneration 
and discoverability.[^context-1]

EU-level studies and policy frameworks have recognised these dynamics and increasingly 
frame them as systemic challenges. The *Feasibility Study for the Establishment of a 
European Music Observatory* diagnosed the fragmented, scarce, and poorly harmonised 
nature of music data collection across Member States, calling it the fundamental reason 
for an EU-level observatory to ensure comparability, transparency, and regular monitoring. 
The *Music Ecosystem 2025 study* reframes the sector as an interconnected ecosystem, 
where platformisation, market consolidation, and emerging technologies like AI interact 
with broader societal challenges such as precarity, gender inequality, and sustainability. 
The European Parliament, in its Resolution on cultural diversity and the conditions for 
authors in the European music streaming market, has echoed these concerns with explicit 
calls for reform.[^context-2]

Our policy brief positions itself within this policy landscape. It aims to support and 
extend the Music Moves Europe framework by highlighting three crucial dimensions:  

1. **Practical solutions**, grounded in interdisciplinary dialogue between research and 
   industry, and inspired by concrete experiences with open, federated data-sharing 
   approaches. These solutions can reduce duplication of work, lower costs, and improve 
   interoperability across rights management, libraries, archives, and digital platforms.  

2. **Potential pitfalls** in the implementation of certain policy proposals, particularly 
   where well-meaning initiatives may clash with the realities of legacy systems, existing 
   business practices, or contradictions in legislation. Our aim is to point out where 
   promising ideas might fail without careful attention to operational details.  

3. **Legal and operational conflicts**, such as the tension between GDPR’s data protection 
   regime and the Berne Convention’s requirement of author attribution, or the challenge 
   of creating a more open and complete metadata registration system while at the same time 
   sustaining incentives for costly — and currently mostly private — investments in the 
   maintenance of key registers like ISWC (works), ISRC (recordings), ISNI (creators), 
   and IPN (performer numbers).  

By foregrounding these issues, the brief contributes to the broader direction set by the 
European Parliament and the Commission. It stresses that any effective response to the 
transformations brought by AI — both agentic and generative — must include a 
comprehensive overhaul of metadata practices, robust governance of identifiers, and 
integration with open science and cultural heritage infrastructures. In this sense, our 
approach complements the calls of the *Music Ecosystem 2025 study* and the Observatory 
feasibility work for systemic, ecosystem-wide policies, while remaining attentive to the 
practical challenges of implementation across Europe’s diverse music and cultural 
landscapes.

*Feasibility Study for the Establishment of a European Music Observatory* [@emo_feasibility_2020]; stresses the fragmented, scarce, and poorly harmonised nature of music data (pp. 9–10), the need for cooperation with rights organisations, statistical agencies, and industry stakeholders (p. 61), and introduces CEEMID as a best practice (pp. 147–148). CEEMID emerged from Budapest, Bratislava, and Zagreb as an early effort to address data poverty in Eastern EU Member States.  

[^context-2]: *European Parliament Resolution on cultural diversity and the conditions for authors in the European music streaming market* [@ep_resolution_music_streaming_2024]; it recognises streaming as the dominant global revenue source while leaving many authors with very low income (recitals F–H), stresses accurate metadata allocation at the time of creation using identifiers ISWC, ISRC, ISNI, IPI, and IPN (recital R), highlights the lack of quality data to properly identify authors, performers, and rights holders (recital L), and warns that AI-generated tracks are flooding streaming platforms, aggravating discoverability and remuneration imbalances (recital O).
