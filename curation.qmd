# Data Collection, Improvement & Exchange

**Scope:** Bottom + middle layers combined: primary data capture/curation; technical & semantic improvement; identifier hygiene; practical exchange between institutions.

### Executive summary (what we propose)

-   Establish shared, low-friction pipelines for capturing and improving music metadata at source (creation, release, registration, distribution, preservation), with simple mechanisms for reuse across stakeholders.
-   Prioritise persistent identifier coverage and crosswalks (ISWC↔ISRC↔ISNI↔IPN↔VIAF↔Wikidata) to reduce reconciliation costs and leakage.
-   Produce lightweight exchange patterns (profiles) that smaller actors can actually implement.

## Discussion

-   Streaming-era inefficiencies and micro-transaction reality; identifier silos and reconciliation overheads; feasibility/Observatory emphasis on harmonised, comparable data; *Music Ecosystem 2025*’s ecosystem framing.
-   Industry practice: CISAC/IFPI/ISO identifier regimes; library/archives practice on authority files; Wikimedia/Wikidata as low-cost backbone.

### Data fragmentation as a structural fact

In the music ecosystem, data is not simply decentralised by design but *structurally scattered*. Rights metadata is maintained by hundreds of collective management organisations and publishers, while recordings and distribution data are spread across labels, distributors, and global platforms. Libraries and archives manage their own authority files, often linked only imperfectly to international standards such as ISNI, VIAF, or ISBN. Independent projects and community-driven infrastructures, such as *Wikidata* and Wikibase, add yet another layer of documentation.

This fragmentation is not an anomaly but the normal condition of the sector: tens of thousands of micro-enterprises and NGOs in Europe each manage slivers of data about works, recordings, or performances. As the *Feasibility Study for a European Music Observatory* underlined, *“the fragmented, scarce and poorly harmonised nature of the data collection landscape in the field of music has led to calls … for a European Music Observatory”* [@emo_feasibility_2020, p9]. Likewise, the *Music Ecosystem 2025* study frames the sector as an ecosystem, where knowledge and value are distributed across many small actors, each with partial perspectives [@music_ecossytem_2025, pp6–7].

Recognising this scattered landscape is essential. It explains why reconciliation overheads are high, why identifier coverage is incomplete, and why “capture once, reuse many” pipelines are necessary. It also provides the foundation for the next chapter: explaining why *attempts at centralisation are futile* in such an ecosystem, and why sustainable solutions must build on federation and interoperability.

### Legacy Metadata

The European Parliament has emphasised that accurate and standardised metadata is essential for ensuring fair remuneration and proper attribution in the music streaming market. It calls for identifiers such as ISWC, ISRC, ISNI, IPI and IPN to be allocated at the moment of creation, highlights the systemic problems caused by poor data quality, and warns that the flood of AI-generated tracks further exacerbates discoverability and revenue imbalances if metadata remains incomplete or inconsistent.[^ep-resolution]  

[^ep-resolution]: European Parliament resolution of 17 January 2024 on cultural diversity and the conditions for authors in the European music streaming market, recital 32.

While we fully agree with this goal, we have witnessed in the past years how difficult it is to achieve. This is partly due to data protection issues (introduced later), and partly because the registers that underpin music metadata are privately governed, require continuous investment, and cannot be rebuilt from scratch. Hundreds of millions of assets are in circulation, with billions of transactions handled annually, all of which rely on this existing infrastructure. Moreover, the very use of the word *metadata* is misleading in the music industry: while in libraries and IT it usually means descriptive information (title, genre, provenance), in music business practice it refers narrowly to administrative identifiers that drive royalty distribution. This terminological gap itself contributes to misunderstandings and misplaced expectations.  

The _International Standard Recording Code_ (**ISRC**) was introduced in 1986 as a 12-character identifier for individual sound and video recordings, formalised in ISO 3901 [@iso_isrc_2019]. Operational management was placed with the IFPI, which continues to publish practical guidance [@isrc_handbook_2021]. National agencies began implementation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and by 1991–1992 IFPI and the RIAA had circulated operational recommendations. A revision of ISO 3901 in 2001 and later updates sought to address shortcomings in registrant roles and metadata practices as digital distribution became dominant. Despite these efforts, persistent problems include retroactive assignment, inconsistent embedding, and weak interoperability with other identifiers such as ISWC [@paskin-2006, p4]. The ISRC system reflects the pre-internet era: much like the *International Standard Book Number* (**ISBN**, ISO 2108) which predated widespread online catalogues, ISRC relied on decentralised registrant ranges distributed by post and manually reported back [@iso_isbn_2017].  

The _International Standard Musical Work Code_ (**ISWC**) was standardised later, as ISO 15707 [@iso_iswc_2022], and is managed centrally by CISAC through the ISWC Agency. It was designed to identify musical works (compositions, lyrics), complementing ISRC’s recording-level scope. Yet adoption has been hindered by data-quality problems: duplicate ISWCs for the same work, mismatches between ISWC and ISRC, and governance challenges within collective management organisations. As Paskin observed nearly twenty years ago, the fundamental issues of interoperability and reliability across identifier systems were already well recognised but unresolved [@paskin-2006, p7].  

Often overlooked in this debate is the _International Standard Music Number_ (**ISMN**, ISO 10957), which identifies printed music publications [@iso_ismn_2021]. ISMN plays a bridging role: it links the abstract work level of ISWC with the concrete manifestations of print editions, enabling continuity between bibliographic and rights-management practices. Despite its potential, ISMN remains underused in digital workflows and is rarely considered in discussions of streaming-era metadata.  

Together, ISRC, ISWC, and ISMN form the backbone of music identification. Their coexistence illustrates both the strength and fragility of the current system: robust in theory, but in practice plagued by legacy design, inconsistent uptake, and high maintenance costs. This makes the European Parliament’s ambitions difficult to realise without new layers of interoperability, observability, and shared responsibility.

### Named-Entity Resolution and Privacy 

The Parliament also calls for the wider use of personal identifiers such as ISNI, IPI and IPN alongside ISWC and ISRC to strengthen attribution and royalty allocation. Here, however, we must underline the extreme difficulty introduced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has not exempted music metadata from its scope. Unlike purely technical identifiers, these person-related identifiers inevitably link back to names, which GDPR classifies as personal data when referring to living individuals.  

For centuries, the most important identifiers in music were simply the *names* of authors or main performers, and the *titles* of works and performances. These are central to copyright attribution, as well as to the registration and administration of works and recordings. It is not possible to circulate a composition in print or digital format without disclosing the author’s name, since ISWC allocation requires it, nor can a sound recording of a performance—whether live or studio—be distributed without the names of its interpreters attached.  

The use of names and other named entities (including titles) is therefore not an optional practice but a structural necessity, embedded in centuries of cataloguing tradition and reinforced by Europe’s system of *author’s right*. Unlike Anglo-American copyright law, which can separate moral rights from economic rights, most European jurisdictions constitutionally guarantee attribution to the creator. It is legally impossible—and practically inconceivable—for a music library, archive, webshop, record store, streaming service, music journal, or blog to “blur out” the names of authors and performers.  

Yet, under GDPR, the names of living creators and performers fall under the category of personal data. This creates a profound legal and operational tension: the very information that is mandatory for copyright attribution and royalty distribution is simultaneously regulated as private personal data. Our experience shows that GDPR applies differently across the ecosystem: universities and libraries benefit from derogations and special roles in handling personal data for cultural or academic purposes, while collective management organisations, labels, distributors, and streaming platforms face much stricter obligations. In practice, this forces private actors to perform complex balancing tests to justify legitimate interests when processing names and identifiers. These tests are costly, must be repeated for each dataset, and offer no legal certainty—challenges can still be raised against them. One consortium partner spent countless hours handling GDPR complaints that were ultimately meritless but still drained resources and delayed projects.[^skcmd-balancing]  

While the Parliament’s call for systematic identifier usage is laudable, it cannot be fulfilled without addressing this structural contradiction between attribution (a legal obligation under copyright law) and privacy (a legal obligation under data protection law). This contradiction sits at the heart of the metadata problem, and any practical solution must grapple with it. In subsequent sections we will outline how we approach this challenge.  

## Policy proposals

-   Pilots: Slovak CMD + MusicBase for capture and reconciliation; Open Music Registers for cross-domain linking; Unlabel for “document once, reuse many” (distribution + preservation).
-   Deliverables: (a) “Capture once, reuse many” profile pack; (b) minimal identifier coverage checklist; (c) recommended crosswalk templates and validation scripts.
-   Standards/regulation/public investment: call out per subsection (e.g., GDPR for name exposure; DCMI/METS/MODS/DCAT/JSON-LD profiles; EOSC/ECCCH/Europeana alignment).

### Reducing Redundancy

The European Parliament has rightly highlighted that fragmented and unreliable metadata remains a major obstacle in the music sector. We agree with this diagnosis, but stress that the root cause lies partly in the need for backward compatibility with several hundred million legacy assets, and in the costly redundancy of today’s practices: the same information must be repeatedly entered into separate systems such as ISNI, ISWC, ISRC, VIAF, or local authority files. This duplication creates errors, increases costs, and discourages accurate registration.  

Our policy solution is to encourage the parallelisation of registration processes and the harmonisation of the data that enters costly, manually curated registers. We demonstrate this approach with our *Open Music Registers* pilot: a federated infrastructure designed to enable harmonised, parallel, and redundancy-free registration. Instead of duplicating efforts, the registers interconnect persistent identifiers (ISWC, ISRC, ISNI, VIAF) and link them where relevant to business and statistical identifiers (OpenCorporates, NACE, ISCO). This allows music creators and organisations to benefit from smoother workflows, while downstream users gain more reliable data for royalty distribution, cultural visibility, and AI-driven discovery.  

The Open Music Registers deliberately avoid centralisation. Each registrar—collective management organisations, libraries, archives, or statistical offices—retains ownership of its data, but contributes to a shared semantic framework built on the European Interoperability Framework and the 8-Star FAIR model. By connecting rather than merging registers, we reduce redundancy while safeguarding subsidiarity, accountability, and trust across public and private actors. This distributed model directly answers Parliament’s call for metadata systems that are reliable, inclusive, and supportive of creators.[^registers]

### Reconciling Attribution and Privacy  

The problem of reconciling copyright attribution with GDPR obligations cannot be solved by ignoring either side: both are binding legal requirements. Our approach, tested in the _Slovak Comprehensive Music Database_ (SkCMD), shows that progress is possible through layered governance and careful balancing. Academic institutions and libraries, with their cultural and research mandates, can lawfully handle personal data under derogations for public-interest processing. Collective management organisations (CMOs) and private actors, by contrast, must rely on legitimate interest tests, supported by transparent documentation, notification to rightsholders, and opt-out mechanisms where possible.  

Balancing tests play a central role: each dataset is audited, divided into *public* and *non-public* categories, and then assessed again for personal vs. non-personal data. Public information such as names of authors, performers, and work titles—already widely available in catalogues and concert programmes—can justifiably be shared under legitimate interest, especially when linked to rights management purposes. Sensitive data (e.g. addresses, nationality, pseudonyms) require stricter access tiers and are only made available to selected stakeholders under contractual safeguards.  

This layered compliance model does not eliminate GDPR challenges, but it creates a robust defence: it demonstrates that the legitimate interest in accurate attribution and royalty distribution outweighs the minimal risks of publishing already public information. In practice, this means rights metadata can circulate across the ecosystem while privacy-sensitive data are contained. Building such workflows into federated observatories and data spaces allows the music sector to comply with data protection rules without undermining attribution, and provides a model for European-scale solutions.  


### Pragmatic Metadata Alignment (Enhanced with Cross-Domain Examples)

Attempts to build one comprehensive, harmonised schema for music metadata have repeatedly failed. The sector is too heterogeneous: collective management organisations, libraries, archives, distributors, and platforms all operate with different standards and governance models. Pursuing a single “giga-ontology” would be prohibitively costly, brittle, and ultimately futile.

Our policy solution is to promote *pattern-based modular alignment*, where small, reusable ontology design patterns (ODPs) are used to model recurring structures such as **Agent–Role–Activity**, **Work–Recording–Performance**, or **Event–Time–Place**. This method, formalised in the *eXtreme Design* (XD) approach to be used together with pattern-based development, allows interoperability to be achieved incrementally and pragmatically, without forcing any actor to abandon its systems. The Polifonia project has already demonstrated how XD and ODPs can underpin modular music ontologies at European scale[^polifonia].

[^polifonia:] Working with ontological patterns can be reviewed in [@gangemi_ontology_2005; @blomqvist_engineering_2016; @carriero_pattern-based_2021] as method; the Polifonia project applied it to create a new family of modular music ontologies [@de_berardinis_polifonia_2023].

Other domains provide useful analogies for this approach. For instance, **ORCID** identifiers have been increasingly reconciled with **VIAF** authority files using reconciliation services such as OpenRefine, helping to unify researcher identity across research and library systems without enforcing a single authority file [@openrefine_refine_services, @jegan2023authority]. 
Similarly, the **DataCite to Dublin Core mapping**, as formalised in DataCite's v4.4 schema, shows how two widely used metadata data repository and library standards can be aligned systematically and bidirectionally, while retaining their distinct schema scopes [@datacite_to_dublincore_2021].

In music, similar periodic reconciliation is necessary across identifier systems. As Paskin highlighted, **ISRC** (for recordings), **ISWC** (for works), and **ISMN** (for printed music) were designed separately and risk divergence if not actively maintained [@paskin2006identifier]. The same applies to personal and organisational identifiers like **ISNI**, **VIAF**, and **IPI**. Without regular cross-checking, authority records can fragment, causing duplication and inconsistency.

In our pilots, this modular alignment approach was tested effectively. The *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database* used modular ODPs to reconcile rights identifiers (ISWC, ISRC) with library authorities (VIAF, ISNI) without schema unification. *MusicBase* implemented these patterns in Wikibase, encoding roles, events, and provenance via property–qualifier bundles and enabling corrections in one register to propagate to others. The *Unlabel* pathway streamlined metadata capture for self-releasing artists and libraries by allowing a once-only documentation process, reused across distribution and preservation systems. This builds directly on our *Open Music Registers* proposal [@open_music_registers_2025], which argued for federated, redundancy-free metadata workflows, now extended into the broader governance framework of this Green Paper.

By focusing on modular patterns instead of monolithic schemas, we lower entry costs, reduce reconciliation errors, and support federated alignment flexible enough to accommodate European diversity. This pragmatic approach answers Parliament’s demand for interoperable metadata systems [@ep_resolution_music_streaming_2024, p.19], while avoiding the shortcomings of over-centralisation and standardisation.
