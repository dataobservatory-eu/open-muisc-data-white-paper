# Applications: AI that Serves the Music Ecosystem
**Scope:** Top layer: applied services that ride on the data space (curative, agentic, and generative uses); shared AI capacity so SMEs/NGOs aren’t forced to hire scarce talent.

### Executive summary (what we propose)
- Create *shared AI services* (not bespoke in-house teams) for entity recognition, duplicate detection, cross-catalogue matching, multilingual enrichment, and compliance monitoring.
- Educate stakeholders using a simple three-part model of AI (agentic/generative/curative) tied to concrete tasks and guardrails.

### Literature & standpoints (who says what)
- EP resolution on AI-generated flooding and discoverability/remuneration risks; ecosystem report on AI as disruption *and* opportunity.
- Practical gaps: SMEs/CMOs lack AI engineers; asymmetry with platform capabilities.

### Our solution (how we do it)
- Operate pooled “AI utilities” behind clear SLAs: reconciliation-as-a-service; watchlists for plagiarism/near-duplicates; machine-assisted translations/summaries for archival deposits.
- Governance/ethics by design: audit logs, explainability notes, error budgets; opt-in data sharing; “green list” of permissible automations per partner.
- Standards/regulation/public investment inline: model/data licensing; consent and transparency; targeted public funding for shared services.
