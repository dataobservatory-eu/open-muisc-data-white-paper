	abstract = {Information science, like any discipline, has its share of jargon terms. The word “metadata” is one of these, though it has crept into more common usage in the past few years. To investigate metadata, as this book does, inevitably also means to encounter other jargon terms. In this chapter we will explore these terms, and define them as best as possible.  The most common—and perhaps least useful—definition of metadata is that it is “data about data.” As catchy as this definition is, however, it is entirely ambiguous. First of all, what is data? And second, what does “about”},
