abstract = {As academic libraries continue to face acquisition budget challenges, collaborative collection development (CCD) offers greater opportunities to fulfill the core role of library collecting and collection management, namely, to provide enhanced access to the widest variety of relevant resources in the most cost-responsible manner possible. Libraries have successfully implemented CCD projects of various types, and as a result, have achieved these needed cost savings. The authors conducted survey research to investigate current CCD activities and librarians' perceptions of its benefits, drawbacks, elements contributing to successful CCD programs, and possible obstacles to success. Library collections consist of a variety of material formats and librarians have applied CCD models to maintain needed access to these resources, shifting from ownership to access, all in support of building collective collections. The survey results found that, although challenges can exist, application of CCD activities have realized substantial benefits, financial and otherwise, for academic libraries overall.},

This article addresses the task and reveals four major presumptions associated with collections: tangibility, ownership, a user community, and an integrated retrieval mechanism. Some of these presumptions have served only to perpetuate misconceptions of collection. Others seem to have become more relevant in the current information environment. The emergence of nontraditional media, such as the World Wide Web ({WWW}), poses two specific challenges: to question the necessity of finite collections, and contest the boundaries of a collection. A critical analysis of these issues results in a proposal for an expanded concept of collection that considers the perspectives of both the user and the collection developer, invites rigorous user-centered research, and looks at the collection as an information-seeking context.},

abstract = {Abstract The concept of a collection plays key roles in library, museum, and archival practice, and is arguably fundamental to information organization systems in general. Locating collection concepts in a reasonably robust ontology should have a number of practical advantages, including revealing inferencing opportunities and supporting consistency and coherence in system design and modeling. Although research practices involving collections have been studied empirically there has been surprisingly little attention given to the formal analysis of the concept itself, or to related notions like collection membership. With this paper we hope to convene that discussion, beginning with the question: Are collections sets? We consider in detail the substantial arguments against collections being a kind of set, but argue that at least one version of that claim cannot yet be ruled out. As ontology decisions, both practical and theoretical, are often more a matter of weighing competing considerations than making decisive arguments, progress on this question will probably require the comparison of alternative theories. We invite the information science community to join us in exploring the possibilities.},

Our findings reveal high variability and ambiguity in the collection construct.

	abstract = {More and more libraries, archives, and museums are creating online collections of digitized resources. Where can those charged with organizing these new collections turn for guidance on the actual practice of metadata design and creation? "Metadata for Digital Collections: A How-to-do-it Manual" is suitable for libraries, archives, and museums. This practical, hands-on volume will make it easy for readers to acquire the knowledge and skills they need, whether they use the book on the job or in a classroom. Author Steven Miller introduces readers to fundamental concepts and practices in a style accessible to beginners and {LIS} students, as well as experienced practitioners with little metadata training. He also takes account of the widespread use of digital collection management systems such as {CONTENTdm}. Rather than surveying a large number of metadata schemes, Miller covers only three of the schemes most commonly used in general digital resource description, namely, Dublin Core, {MODS}, and {VRA}. By limiting himself, Miller is able to address the chosen schemes in greater depth. He is also able to include numerous practical examples that clarify common application issues and challenges. He provides practical guidance on applying each of the Dublin Core elements, taking special care to clarify those most commonly misunderstood. The book includes a step-by-step guide on how to design and document a metadata scheme for local institutional needs and for specific digital collection projects. The text also serves well as an introduction to broader metadata topics, including {XML} encoding, mapping between different schemes, metadata interoperability and record sharing, {OAI} harvesting, and the emerging environment of Linked Data and the Semantic Web, explaining their relevance to current practitioners and students. Each chapter offers a set of exercises, with suggestions for instructors. A companion website includes additional practical and reference resources. -- Amazon Book Description.},

Abstract = {Today's music industry increasingly favors online-only, direct-to-consumer distribution. No longer can librarians expect to collect recordings on tangible media where first-sale doctrine applies. Instead, at an ever-increasing rate, librarians are discovering that music recordings are available only via such online distribution sites as iTunes or Amazon .com. These distributors require individual purchasers to agree to restrictive end-user license agreements (EULAs) that explicitly forbid institutional ownership and such core library functions as lending. What does this mean for the future of music libraries? The coauthors present an overview of an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) funded project tasked with investigating the issue, and recommend a series of next steps designed to build our professional capacity toward addressing the challenge.

	abstract = {Research in the humanities involves articulating claims about the phenomena under investigation. In musicology, for instance, scholars may assert claims about the authorship of a composition, its structural features, or its similarity to other pieces. Effective models for knowledge representation and data management must therefore document both cultural artifacts and the claims associated with them. This paper aims to contribute to the interdisciplinary intersection of humanities, specifically musicology and computer science by presenting an ontology for claims. The paper utilizes knowledge representation techniques, particularly focusing on Semantic Web languages and technologies. These include the adoption of an ontology-based data access system to develop a prototype web application to navigate through data in a relational format. Additionally, drawing from a musicological standpoint, our work stems from a project in Early Music (roughly that period of European music history from about the year 1000 to 1600), providing requirements and case studies to illustrate our ontology within a tangible context. This paper introduces the Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music ({OMAC}), a novel ontology intended for documenting musical compositions and associated scholarly claims. Throughout the paper, we justify the ontology in relation to similar existing efforts, elucidating the similarities and distinctions from models such as Library Reference Model Object Oriented ({LRMoo}). The paper presents the {OMAC} ontology, outlining its developmental motivations and core modeling choices. Future endeavors will focus on augmenting the ontology with additional modeling elements through close collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders. These enhancements will aim to accommodate diverse types of claims and musical entities. Additionally, future work will explore utilizing the ontology in conjunction with other techniques for data analysis and comparison.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to cataloguing has always been based on the investigation of the characteristics of the objects in collections that are most relevant to the construction of catalogues. The evolution of cataloguing theory has therefore led to the identification and analysis of entities with those characteristics and to the construction of a logical model capable of explaining bibliographic phenomena in an increasingly refined manner. That approach also led to the definition of RiCCM and CIDOC-CRM models. In addition to this valid point of view, a second perspective is proposed, which takes into account the entities identified in the logical models developed in the library, archive and museum models as part of the much larger, richer and more numerous ontologies of the semantic web, represented by the Linked Open Data Cloud. In this perspective, the logical models of libraries, archives, and museums can be seen as some of the possible infinite modelling of web entities, constructed in the light of the principles and tradition of each subject area. This new perspective helps to better clarify the role of data professionals, the concept of metadata, the characteristics of logical models and to take a unified view of the bibliographic, archival and museum universes.},
